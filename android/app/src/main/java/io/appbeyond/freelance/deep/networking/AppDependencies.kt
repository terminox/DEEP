/**
 * The composition root. One instance, built in [io.appbeyond.freelance.deep.DeepApplication].
 *
 * Wired by hand rather than by an injection framework, mirroring
 * `Deep/Deep/Networking/AppDependencies.swift`. That file does not describe a
 * dependency graph so much as an ordered, mutually-referential wiring: it builds
 * the rewards remote, then the ledger and the garden over it, then closes an
 * `ingestAwards` lambda over both, then hands that lambda to the practice store,
 * the sound player and the pause session. Expressed in Hilt it would collapse
 * into one `@Provides` that does the same wiring anyway, for the price of an
 * annotation processor in the build and friction in every `@Preview`.
 *
 * Read it top to bottom: config, the session store, the client over it, the one
 * Retrofit built on that client, then the repositories. Stores arrive here as the
 * weeks land.
